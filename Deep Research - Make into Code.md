GPT Instruction Set
LearnPrompting’s mission is to upskill people in AI prompt engineering, and its vibrant community (over 40,000 Discord members) is at the heart of this mission (Learn Prompting: Your Guide to Communicating with AI). The custom GPT will act as an interactive prompt engineering mentor aligned with these goals. It will cover the full spectrum of prompt engineering knowledge – from fundamental techniques to advanced jailbreak methods – while emphasizing ethical use and safety. Key content areas include prompt design fundamentals, advanced strategies, jailbreak techniques (prompt injection attacks), and defense mechanisms to counter malicious prompts (Learn Prompting: Your Guide to Communicating with AI). The assistant’s persona will be knowledgeable and friendly, guiding users through concepts and highlighting ethical considerations (e.g. it explains that jailbreaks should be studied for defense and not for misuse, echoing OpenAI’s guidelines to avoid circumventing safeguards except for approved research) (Usage policies | OpenAI).
To maximize learning, the GPT will use interactive engagement methods. Rather than just lecturing, it will involve members in gamified exercises to reinforce prompt engineering skills. For example, the bot can host periodic quizzes or trivia questions on prompt engineering topics (with immediate feedback and explanations) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). It can also present challenges – e.g. giving a prompt and asking the user to improve it or showing a “jailbreak” attempt and asking how to defend against it – to let members apply concepts in practice ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). Additionally, role-playing scenarios will make learning fun: the GPT might simulate a scenario where it behaves as a “rogue AI” or a misinformed model, and the user must use prompt techniques to correct or contain it. These interactive elements (quizzes, challenges, and role-plays) keep users engaged and make the Discord server a hands-on learning environment. By combining comprehensive content with engagement, the GPT instruction set will educate users on everything from crafting effective prompts to understanding and mitigating prompt-based attacks, all while upholding ethical AI use.
Summary of Instruction Set Features:
•	Comprehensive Prompt Engineering Topics: Covers basics to advanced techniques, including prompt formatting, chaining, context management, and cutting-edge methods. Also discusses jailbreak tactics (like prompt injection, DAN-style prompts, etc.) and how they work, as well as defense strategies to guard against them (Learn Prompting: Your Guide to Communicating with AI). The GPT will share best practices for safe prompt design and content filtering to reinforce AI safety alongside creativity.
•	Ethical Guidance: The GPT will consistently remind and educate users about ethical use of AI. When discussing jailbreaks or exploit techniques, it will clarify the intended educational purpose and discourage malicious use, in line with OpenAI policies (e.g. not actually facilitating harm or policy violations) (Usage policies | OpenAI). It will encourage users to experiment in a responsible way and highlight real-world implications of prompt misuse vs. benefits of safe prompting.
•	Interactive Learning: The bot will engage members with quizzes and flashcards (e.g. multiple-choice questions about prompt techniques or scenarios), “try it yourself” challenges, and guided role-playing. For instance, it might say “Let’s practice a prompt injection: I am the AI with a secret instruction – try to get me to reveal it,” then debrief the attempt to illustrate defense techniques. Such gamified sessions echo recommended strategies for community engagement (hosting quizzes, interactive sessions, storytelling, etc.) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI) and help solidify users’ skills through practice and feedback.
•	Persona and Tone: The GPT will maintain an approachable, encouraging tone, acting as both teacher and teammate. It will congratulate users on solving challenges and provide hints if they get stuck. In role-play, it will stay in character to make scenarios realistic, then step out to explain the lessons. This dynamic persona keeps the learning process both fun and informative, aligning with LearnPrompting’s community-driven approach.
By following this instruction set, the custom GPT will not only answer questions about prompt engineering, but actively coach the community through hands-on learning, covering everything from creative prompt crafting to understanding the latest jailbreak techniques and how to defend against them.
Discord Bot Integration Guide (Node.js + OpenAI API)
Integrating the custom GPT into LearnPrompting’s Discord involves creating a bot backed by OpenAI’s API. Below is a step-by-step guide using Node.js (with the discord.js library) and OpenAI’s API, designed with modularity for future commands:
1.	Create a Discord Application and Bot: Log in to the Discord Developer Portal and create a new application. Give it a name (e.g. “LearnPromptingGPT”) and add a Bot to the application ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). Discord will generate a Bot Token – copy this token and keep it secure (we’ll use it soon). In the bot settings, enable the “Message Content Intent” so the bot can read user messages (this is required for bots in fewer than 100 servers to receive message content).
2.	Invite the Bot to the Server: Still in the Developer Portal, go to the OAuth2 section to generate an invite URL. Under “Scopes”, select bot, and under “Bot Permissions”, choose the permissions the bot needs (at minimum, read/send messages; you might also include manage messages if quizzes require deletion, etc.) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). Copy the generated OAuth invite link and visit it in your browser. Select the LearnPrompting Discord server and authorize the bot. After completing any CAPTCHA, the bot should join the server (you’ll see it appear in the member list) (Build a GPT-3 Discord Chatbot with Node.js | Twilio) (Build a GPT-3 Discord Chatbot with Node.js | Twilio).
3.	Set Up the Node.js Project: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). On your development machine or server, create a new directory for the bot and initialize a Node.js project: npm init -y. Next, install the required packages: discord.js (to interact with Discord’s API) and openai (OpenAI’s official Node.js SDK) – and optionally dotenv for configuration management. For example: npm install discord.js openai dotenv (Build a GPT-3 Discord Chatbot with Node.js | Twilio) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). This will add the libraries to your project. Create a file bot.js (or index.js) for the bot’s code. In this file, require the libraries and set up configuration. For security, store your secrets (the Bot Token and OpenAI API key) in an environment file (e.g. a .env file) and load them with dotenv instead of hardcoding. For instance, your .env would contain OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key> and DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your-token> (Build a GPT-3 Discord Chatbot with Node.js | Twilio), which you can load in code so that sensitive keys aren’t exposed in your code repository.
4.	Implement the Bot’s Core Logic: In your bot.js, initialize the Discord client and OpenAI client, then write the message-handling logic. For example, use const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js'); and create a new client with the necessary intents (Guilds, GuildMessages, and MessageContent so it can respond to messages) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). Initialize OpenAI by requiring Configuration, OpenAIApi from the OpenAI SDK and providing your API key. Next, log in the Discord client with your bot token. Once the bot is online (client.once('ready', ...) event), set up a listener for messages. Using Discord.js v14, you can do:
5.	client.on('messageCreate', async (message) => {
6.	    if (message.author.bot) return; // ignore other bots
7.	    // e.g., simple behavior: send user message to OpenAI and reply with answer
8.	    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
9.	        model: "text-davinci-003",
10.	        prompt: message.content,
11.	        max_tokens: 150,
12.	    });
13.	    const reply = response.data.choices[0].text.trim();
14.	    message.channel.send(reply);
15.	});
This example takes any incoming message and feeds it to OpenAI, then replies with the generated text ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI). In practice, you’ll refine this: for instance, you might trigger only on specific commands (to avoid responding to every single message in the server), or use OpenAI’s Chat Completion API for multi-turn conversation memory. Ensure to handle errors (using try/catch around the API call) and consider rate limits (the bot shouldn’t flood the API or Discord; you may add short delays or limits if needed). At this stage, run node bot.js to test – the bot should come online (logging “Logged in as ...”) ( How to Integrate OpenAI with Discord – Omi AI) and respond to messages with AI-generated answers. Test in a private channel first to fine-tune its behavior.
16.	Modular Command Design for Future Features: To allow easy expansion, structure the bot with a command handler pattern rather than all logic in one place. For example, use Discord slash commands for distinct functionalities (like /quiz, /explain, /challenge). Create separate command files or modules for each command, defining their behavior (question logic, etc.), and have your main bot file dynamically load these commands on startup (Command handling | discord.js Guide). Discord’s API allows registering slash commands with name/description and then listening for them. With discord.js, you can maintain a collection of commands and dispatch to the correct handler when a command is invoked (Command handling | discord.js Guide). This modular approach means adding a new quiz or game command is as simple as dropping in a new file and registering it, without modifying the core bot code. It also improves maintainability – each feature’s code is isolated. Ensure your project structure is organized (e.g. a commands/ directory with files like quiz.js, challenge.js, etc.). Each can export an execute function that the main bot calls. This way, the bot can easily grow with the community’s needs. (For example, if later you want a /leaderboard command for quiz scores, you can add it without refactoring existing logic.)
Best Practices: Keep your bot token and API key private (use environment variables as noted). Use a version control system (Git) to track changes. Test new commands in a safe channel or test server before deploying to the main community. Aim to handle exceptions so the bot doesn’t crash on bad inputs – log errors and continue running. By following this integration guide, you’ll have a Discord bot connected to OpenAI that is flexible and easy to expand with new prompt engineering training features.
Hosting Recommendations
When deploying the Discord GPT bot, you’ll want a hosting solution that is reliable, scalable for community growth, and cost-effective. Here are some options to consider:
•	Platform-as-a-Service (Heroku or Railway): Services like Heroku simplify deployment – you can push your Node.js app and let the platform run it 24/7. Heroku offers a free tier, which is convenient for initial testing, but note that it sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity and has usage limits (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). For continuous uptime, a paid Heroku “dyno” (~$7/month) is needed (The Definitive Discord Bot Hosting Guide In 2023 (Updated)). Pros: very easy setup (integrates with GitHub for auto-deploy), no server management, and auto-scaling to some extent (The Definitive Discord Bot Hosting Guide In 2023 (Updated)). Cons: The free tier’s constraints and costs can grow if your bot becomes highly active or if you need more computing resources (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). Another PaaS alternative is Railway.app or Red Hat’s OpenShift, which similarly allow you to host Node apps with minimal dev-ops. These are great for convenience, though you pay for that convenience in the long run.
•	Cloud VM or Container (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.): For more control and potentially lower cost at scale, you can host the bot on a Virtual Private Server. Providers like DigitalOcean or Linode offer small Linux VMs (e.g. 1 CPU, 1GB RAM) for around $5-10/month, which is often sufficient for a Discord bot. This option requires you to set up the Node.js environment on the server and run the bot (perhaps using a process manager like PM2 to keep it alive), but gives you full control. Pros: Very cost-effective and reliable if set up correctly (no sleep downtime, fixed monthly cost), and you can customize the environment or install other tools as needed (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). Cons: Requires more technical management (you are responsible for updates, restarts, and security), and there’s no built-in auto-scaling – you’d have to upgrade the server manually if the bot’s needs grow (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). This approach is ideal if you have some sysadmin experience or are willing to maintain a server for the community’s bot. Many large bots use cloud VMs for their predictability. You could also use Docker containers and deploy on services like AWS Lightsail, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances, which give a mix of ease and control.
•	Serverless or Scalable Cloud Services: If you anticipate variable load or want the bot to scale automatically when more users interact, consider cloud services that handle scaling. For example, AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google App Engine can deploy the Node.js bot and automatically allocate more resources as needed. These services provide easy deployment and integrate with their respective cloud ecosystems (databases, monitoring, etc.) (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). AWS also has a free tier for the first year which can cover a small EC2 or Beanstalk environment (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). Pros: Automatic scaling and high reliability – your bot can handle spikes in usage without manual intervention (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid) (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). Cons: These platforms can be overkill for a single bot and might be complex for beginners. Costs can increase if your bot suddenly uses a lot of resources, so monitoring is important (Choosing hosting platforms for Discord bots - Comprehensive Guide to Discord Bot Development with discord.py | StudyRaid). Another angle is serverless functions (AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions), but Discord bots need to maintain a persistent WebSocket connection to Discord, which doesn’t fit well with short-lived function execution. Therefore, a long-running service (VM or container) is typically required. If needed, you could combine a VM with a load balancer in the future if the community grows massively.
In summary, for a community-focused bot, a good starting point is a PaaS like Heroku for ease of deployment or a small cloud VM for more control. If the bot usage grows (e.g. many concurrent users prompting the GPT frequently), you can migrate to a more scalable infrastructure (cloud instances or containers on AWS/GCP) to ensure reliability. Always consider the trade-off between scalability vs. cost: start small and simple, then iterate. Whichever hosting option you choose, ensure the process to deploy updates is smooth (so you can quickly roll out improvements to the GPT’s instruction set or commands), and set up basic monitoring (logs and uptime alerts) so that the bot stays available to LearnPrompting’s community 24/7 (The Definitive Discord Bot Hosting Guide In 2023 (Updated)) (The Definitive Discord Bot Hosting Guide In 2023 (Updated)). By choosing the right hosting plan, the custom Discord GPT will remain responsive, reliable, and ready to educate and engage users at any scale.
